* First go through [Github Guide](https://guides.github.com/activities/hello-world/) 

* To add resources create a folder inside the `Resources` folder by the name of the topic for which  you want to add the resources.
  Add a link to the readme for your resources.

* Create a folder for your project and store all files in it. 
  Add the projects folder in the relevant folders and add a link for the same in the readme.
